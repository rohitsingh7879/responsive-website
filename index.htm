            </p>
            <p class="p res-para">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under
                the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
                Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and
                compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio
                of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.
                Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged
                the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools
                divide into two types: recognized and unrecognized schools. Government 'recognition' is an official
                stamp of approval and for this, a private school is required to fulfill a number of conditions, though
                hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfill all the conditions of recognition.

                At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government
                run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[14] Certain
                post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue
                of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.

            </p>
            <p class="p res-para">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after
                initiation.[27] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his
                Shishya (students /disciples) was very important part of the education.[28] Takshasila (in modern-day
                Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century
                BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since
                teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not
                seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to
                the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in
                the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali language.[29]

                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others.[citation needed] These institutions systematically imparted
                knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature,
                logic, páli grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated
                with founding of Mauryan Empire.</p>

            <p class="p res-para">According to the Census of 2011, "every person above the age of 7 years who can read and write
                with understanding in any language is said to be literate". According to this criterion, the 2011 survey
                holds the national literacy rate to be 74 The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15
                to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females), while 86% of boys and 72% of girls are
                literate in the 10–19 age group.

                Within the Indian states, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93.91% whereas Bihar averaged 61.8%
                literacy. The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of 'absolute non-literates' in the country
                was 304 million Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in Rajasthan, the state with the lowest
                female literacy rate in India,average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male literacy rate is
                80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.


            <p class="p res-para"> While the quality of free, public education is in crisis, a majority of the urban poor have
                turned to private schools. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two-thirds of all students
                attend private institutions, many of which charge a modest US$2 per month.</p>
